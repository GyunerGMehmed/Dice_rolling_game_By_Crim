# Dice_rolling_game_By_Crim


The game started as a simple dice rolling game where when typed "y" you roll a dice and get a random number from 1-6.
Then it was decided to add another dice and when you roll you get 2 numbers and add them up. 
In this case computer get the same 2 dice and he get a roll as well, gets 2 numebr which are added. Forgot to mention that the game has a "Magic number" which  is
randomly generated. The winner is decided when we compare the numbers and the closest to get closest to the "Magic number" wins. The game is based solely luck,
it was made solely for fun.

In the game it's used the random library, made in python 3.12 JetBrains PyCharm.
